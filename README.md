# Learning Hard Quantum Distributions with Variational Autoencoders

## Project Structure
```

```

## Contributing

Project (very loosely) follows a [trunk based development style](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).

- Branches are split off from the `master` branch for features, fixes, and all other development.

### Branch Naming

Branches should be prefixed with the following codes to dentore their purpose:

- `feat`: new feature
- `bug`: bug fix
- `chore`: refactoring and misc. tasks
- `docs`: documentation and testing

#### Example

```
docs-making_this_readme
```

### Committing to `master` branch

Make a merge request from your branch to the master branch, once approved it can be merged into the master branch.
